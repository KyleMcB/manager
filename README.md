Here's a more concise `README.md` that focuses on the core concept of the "Manager" app:


# Manager App

**Manager** is a productivity tool designed to help you manage and complete pre-planned responsibilities efficiently. Whether it's daily tasks, weekly reminders, or one-off duties, Manager ensures you stay on top of your schedule by integrating with your existing calendar services and providing intelligent notifications.

## Key Features

- **Responsibility Management**: Organize and track your recurring or one-time tasks with ease.
- **Calendar Integration**: Sync with popular calendar services like Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and Microsoft Outlook.
- **Daily Agenda**: Receive a personalized summary of your daily tasks every morning, with insights and reminders to help you stay on track.


## Road map

before any actually coding starts I need to learn some new techs. So I am going to make some prototypes

* jvm app that can auth0 into google and get calendar info
* jvm app and phone app. The server will send the apps notifications
* jvm app that can access openAI APIs
* expaned on previous jvm app and phone app so the phone can chat with openAI
